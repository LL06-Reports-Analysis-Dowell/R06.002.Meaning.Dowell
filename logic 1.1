Step 1 : Using delemiters extract the sentence from a paragraph

Step 2  : Sentence Structure
         a)clause
         b)Phrase
         c)words

Step 3 : Bottom up approach-Words(using parts of speech)
         a)noun
         b)verb
         c)adjective
         d)adverb
         e)proposition
         f)determiner
         g)conjuction-after,although,as,as if,because,while(a few conjuction)
           
Step 4 : Phrase(no tool as if now- still searching)
         a)Noun Phrase
         b)Verb phrase
         c)Prepositional phrase

Step 5  : Clausee(no tool as if now- still searching)
          a)Main Clause(Independent Clause)
          b)Subordinate Clause(Dependent Clause)-a subordinate clause will always have a conjuction in front of it(line 13)
          c)Relative Clauses
          d)Noun Clauses

Step 6  : After reaching this part we have to identify the rules for main clause and Subordinate clause.
          for eg: we now have the rule that every subordinate clause will have a conjuction in front in that way we can divide a sentence into main clause and subordinate clause.
